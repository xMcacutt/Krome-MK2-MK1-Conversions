In the mdl, there is a list of meshes.
Components are separated by 00 00 00 00 terminators.
0x68 in the mdl is a pointer to the list.
The list is a list of ints. ie
int1 int2 int3 terminator int4 int5 terminator int6
The ints are references to strips. 
These strips are the first strips of a mesh. 
The mesh consists of strips which are referenced in the previous strip.
Once this reference equals 0, this is the final strip of the mesh.
A component can have multiple meshes.
These meshes are consecutive in the list in the mdl.
